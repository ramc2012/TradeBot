"""Read-only API surface for the Vanguard paper trade-selection lane.

Vanguard (M1-M10) is a research/paper system that lives OUTSIDE this backend --
its code sits in its own git worktree and runs as its own process against the
same Postgres. This router therefore projects Vanguard's TABLES and imports
none of its Python. That is deliberate:

  - the backend must not depend on a worktree path that may not exist in the
    container, and must not import research code into the API process;
  - Vanguard writes on its own cadence (`make daily-cycle`), so the API is a
    reader of whatever that last wrote, never a trigger for it. There is no
    POST here at all -- doctrine #4 forbids an execution layer, and a "run it
    now" button from a browser is exactly the execution layer it forbids.

THE DUPLICATED KNOWLEDGE, AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS LEFT. `/funnel` used to
re-express M6's entire candidate filter in SQL so the UI could show WHERE
candidates die. Two copies of one filter drift, and this one did: it could not
see the freshness legs M6 gained on 2026-08-27 because they are evaluated in
Python, not in the WHERE clause.

Vanguard's migration 006 removed the need for the copy. M6 now journals ONE
ROW PER (bar, symbol) to `candidate_evaluations` -- every input as joined, the
age of each one, and each of its six legs' own verdict -- so the funnel is a
GROUP BY over what the lane actually decided rather than a re-derivation of
what it should have decided. `/funnel` reads that journal and falls back to the
legacy re-derivation only for bars evaluated before the journal existed, which
the response labels `source: "rederived"` so nobody mistakes one for the other.

The thresholds are still mirrored (the UI renders the numbers actually applied
rather than hardcoding its own) and `backend/tests/test_vanguard_router.py`
still reads m6_select.py and asserts they match, failing loudly on a retune.
This is the same technique nav-model.test.ts uses against ViewNav.tsx.

WHY A FUNNEL AT ALL: on today's real data Vanguard emits ZERO tickets -- every
candidate dies at one leg or another, and `tickets` is nearly empty. An empty
table rendered as an empty panel is indistinguishable from a broken feed, which
is precisely the failure nav-model.ts calls out ("an em-dash indistinguishable
from a flat book"). Worse, the two have OPPOSITE meanings here: a reasoned
no-trade is the system working (doctrine #2), a stale feed producing no trade
is the system broken. The funnel is how the UI tells them apart.

WHAT `/market` AND `/symbol/{symbol}` ADD. The desk could previously show that
the lane decided nothing, but not what it decided nothing ABOUT: a trader
looking at VANGUARD could not see a single symbol's collected market
information. Those two endpoints project `candidate_evaluations` plus every
per-symbol feed the lane ingests (flow ingredients, GEX, sector RS, lead-lag,
timing, delivery, bulk/block, announcements) so the desk can render the
evidence, not just the verdict.
