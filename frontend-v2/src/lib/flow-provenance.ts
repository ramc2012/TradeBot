/**
 * flow-provenance — source grading, and the FEATURE-AWARE correction to it.
 *
 * ─── Why this module exists (2026-07-19) ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Grading used to be purely SOURCE-aware: `market_ticks` in ⇒ `observed` out,
 * and every consumer then rendered its order-flow panel as REAL/observed. That
 * overstates the evidence, and the backend says so in plain text:
 *
 *   backend/analytics/orderflow.py (module docstring)
 *     "Indian retail brokers do not push public trade prints to subscribers,
 *      so true Lee-Ready CVD (each trade tagged buy/sell by aggressor) is not
 *      available. These functions approximate the same intuitions from OHLCV
 *      bars + L1 snapshots."
 *
 * Ground truth in the schema (db/migrations/versions/001_initial_schema.py:118):
 * `market_ticks` stores time, symbol, ltp, OHLC, CUMULATIVE volume, oi, bid,
 * ask, bid_qty, ask_qty. There is NO trade_id, NO last-trade quantity and NO
 * broker-supplied aggressor/side. `institutional_convergence/engine.py`
 * `build_footprint` buckets `ltp` and infers the buy/sell split heuristically.
 *
 * So the honest split is:
 *
 *   the QUOTE STREAM and the OHLCV BARS  → genuinely OBSERVED
 *   every buy/sell ATTRIBUTION built on  → MODELLED FROM QUOTES
 *   them (CVD, footprint buy/sell split,
 *   delta, aggression, absorption)
 *   an aggressor-tagged TRADE PRINT tape → UNAVAILABLE (we do not have one)
 *
 * `classifySourceGrade(source)` with no feature keeps its ORIGINAL, unchanged
 * behaviour — it answers "how was this source obtained?", which is what the
 * readiness gates in `OrderflowWorkbench.evaluateReadiness` and
 * `MpDesk.ofBadgeOf` ask. Passing a `feature` answers the sharper question
 * "how was THIS NUMBER obtained?", which is what every flow surface must show.
 *
 * ─── The FOUR AXES (2026-07-19, second correction) ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The first correction over-shot in one place: `snapshot` was added to the
 * bar-inferred set, so the saved ATM watchlist rendered "snapshot · bar
 * inferred · inferred from bars, not a tape". Nothing in that payload says so —
 * a stored snapshot may contain directly OBSERVED quotes. Claiming a WORSE
 * grade than the evidence supports is the same defect as claiming a better one,
 * just pointing the other way.
 *
 * So a datum carries FOUR independent facts, and no axis may set another:
 *
 *   (i)   ACQUISITION SOURCE  what produced it   quote stream | bar | book |
 *                                                model | unknown
 *   (ii)  STORAGE-READ MODE   how we read it     live | snapshot | backfilled |
 *                                                unknown
 *   (iii) FEATURE DERIVATION  how the NUMBER     observed | modelled_from_quotes
 *                             was derived        | modelled | bar_inferred |
 *                                                unknown_derivation | unavailable
 *   (iv)  LIVE-vs-REPLAY      what session it    (lives in `market-semantics`
 *                             describes           as `DataMode`)
 *
 * `snapshot` is a statement about (ii) ONLY. It therefore grades
 * `unknown_derivation` on (iii) — "the payload did not say" — and renders as
 * its own storage chip, never as a bar-inference accusation. The genuinely
 * bar-fabricated sources (`bar_inference`, `historical_bar_inference`,
 * `spot_index_proxy`, `bar_proxy`, …) are untouched and still grade
 * `bar_inferred`.
 *
 * Pure module: no React, no imports, no I/O — so it is unit-testable on its
 * own (see `frontend-v2/tests/flow-provenance.test.ts`).
