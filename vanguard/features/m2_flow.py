"""M2 -- Options Informed-Flow Scanner.

Reads three existing live tables directly (no new collector -- see
db/migrations/001_schema.sql's inventory): `option_premium_candles` (per-
contract IV/delta/OI/volume), `fo_option_chain_metrics` (chain-level OI-PCR)
and `underlying_spot_candles` (stock volume, and a spot-price fallback for
ATM selection). Universe is `sector_taxonomy` (Equity rows only).

WHY "AS-OF" IS NOT TODAY (doctrine #3 + #5, verified live 2026-08-26)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Two of the three source tables are stale, confirmed by direct query rather
than assumed:

  * `fo_option_chain_metrics.time` tops out at 2026-08-03 22:00 UTC (its
    own PK/synced_at rows keep getting touched by a backfill job -- one row
    seen with synced_at=2026-08-26 -- but no *new* `time` value has been
    written past 2026-08-03; 23 days stale as of this run). This is a
    stopped collector, not a quiet-market-hours read.
  * `option_premium_candles.iv` / `.delta` (the per-contract greeks the spec
    needs for IVS and SKEW) go stale even earlier for the *equity* universe:
    every one of the 210 sector_taxonomy equities lost fresh greeks by
    2026-07-28 at the latest (a handful -- RELIANCE, TCS, SBIN, HDFCBANK,
    ICICIBANK, IREDA, KALYANKJIL, SAMMAANCAP -- stopped even earlier, back
    to 2026-06-30). Zero equity names have any `iv` row after 2026-07-28.
    `close`/`oi`/`volume` on the same table keep updating through today --
    only the greeks computation stopped, not the raw feed.

Per doctrine #5 ("if an input isn't currently live/fresh, verify with a
real query first ... do not fabricate or substitute silently"), this module
does NOT force ts=today and report every ingredient NULL for that reason.
Instead it uses "the true max(time) found" (the task's own instruction):
AS_OF_DATE = the newest calendar session for which ANY equity in the
universe still has `iv` data = 2026-07-28, verified live. 200 of 210 names
actually have a chain on that exact date; the other 10 get IVS/SKEW/O-S
stored NULL for this run, per-name, rather than reusing older stale rows
under a false "current" timestamp. `fo_option_chain_metrics` easily covers
2026-07-28 (its own data runs to 2026-08-03), so PCR-OI is computed as of
the same session for consistency.

Caveat worth flagging: 2026-07-28 is itself the last Tuesday of July, i.e.
NSE's monthly stock-options expiry day. The front-month contract is thin by
end of day on its own expiry (see live-run report for per-symbol strike
counts) -- this is a real property of the freshest available session, not
an artifact of this module.

INGREDIENT 4 (delta-OI conjunction): LIVE since 2026-08-28, on option open
interest. It was NULL for every name always, on the reasoning that the spec
frames the conjunction on stock FUTURES OI and no such source exists in this
schema -- `underlying_spot_candles.oi` is 0/NULL for every stock row (only
index rows carry it, and those are spot, not futures) and
`index_futures_candles` covers only BANKNIFTY/NIFTY/SENSEX. All of that is
still true. What was wrong was concluding the ingredient was therefore
uncomputable: `option_premium_candles.oi` is populated on EVERY row (24.3M
rows, 217 underlyings, back to 2024-04-24) and answers the same question the
conjunction asks -- whether positions are being opened or closed into the
move. It now yields ~207 of 210 names every session. See `load_oi_eod` and
`build_oi_series`, and note the rollover guard: front-expiry OI collapses at
each expiry, so delta_oi is measured only across sessions sharing a front
contract.

COMPOSITE NORMALIZATION (documented per doctrine's "renormalize, don't
treat NULL as 0" requirement)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Every ingredient is first mapped onto a common [-1, 1] scale before
weighting, so the weighted sum can be rescaled to [-100, 100] by a single
multiply:
  * ivs_z, skew_z, pcr_z: z-scores, unbounded in principle -- clipped to
    [-3, 3] (the conventional "extreme" cap) then divided by 3.
  * os_pctile: a [0, 1] percentile rank -- centered via (p - 0.5) * 2.
  * oi_state: pre-mapped by the spec itself to {-1, -0.5, 0, +1} -- used
    as-is (already in range).
flow_score = 100 * sum(weight_i * component_i) / sum(weight_i for i not
NULL), i.e. weights (30/25/20/15/10 for IVS/SKEW/O-S/OI/PCR) are
renormalized to sum to 1 over whatever ingredients are actually present for
that name -- NULL never silently contributes 0 to a 100%-weight sum. A name
with zero non-NULL ingredients gets flow_score = NULL, not 0.
