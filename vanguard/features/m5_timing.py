"""M5 -- Microstructure Timing Layer.

Reimplemented independently: does not read from, import, or depend on
`backend/fractal_market_profile/`, `backend/cbe_scanner/`, or their tables
(`market_profiles`, `hourly_profiles`, `cbe_scan_results`, `cbe_scan_runs`).
Reads only `underlying_spot_candles(time, underlying, interval, open, high,
low, close, volume)` at `interval='30minute'` -- 225 underlyings back to
2021, no new collection needed (see db/migrations/001_schema.sql). Also
reads `sector_taxonomy` and `sector_rs` (M4 outputs, read-only) for the
"direction sector RS favours" leg of IGNITION.

Session bars run 09:15-15:15 IST in 30-minute steps (13 bars/session on a
full day; verified live against SAIL/MCX/GLENMARK 2026-08-25: 13 rows,
first bar timestamped 09:15 IST = 03:45 UTC, i.e. bars are start-of-bar
labelled). `underlying_spot_candles.oi` was checked live and found 0/NULL
for every row sampled (RELIANCE, TCS, NIFTY) -- this module never reads it
and needs no OI.

WHY DEVELOPING, NOT RETROSPECTIVE (doctrine #3, no look-ahead)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Every ingredient below -- value area, POC, VWAP-to-date, opening-range state
-- is computed as a *developing* session profile: at bar i, only bars
1..i of that same session are used, mirroring how MACD mini's
`market_profile.py` Profile.add() builds a profile print-by-print rather
than computing it once retrospectively over a whole finished session. Using
the full session's bars (including bars after i) to judge whether bar i is
"beyond value" would be lookahead within the session itself, which is
exactly what the spec's acceptance note ("<=1 bar delay") is testing for --
a retrospective whole-session profile would have zero delay by construction
and would not be a meaningful test at all.

sector_rs is a *daily* M4 output. Using today's own sector_rs row to judge
today's IGNITION would itself be lookahead (today's rs_z20 is only knowable
after today's daily close, same reasoning as the participant-OI archive's
same-day-fetch-after-close pattern). So the sector-direction leg uses the
most recent sector_rs row with ts < session_date -- the last *completed*
session's sector20 reading, never the in-progress one.

THE FOUR INGREDIENTS, AS BUILT (spec names these four; thresholds below are
this build's own choice since the spec does not fully specify them)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. RVOL20 -- this bar's volume / trailing-20-session mean volume of the
   SAME intraday time-of-day bucket (e.g. 10:15-10:45 vs the last 20
   session's own 10:15-10:45 bars), shifted so the current session is never
   in its own trailing window. NULL until 5 prior same-time-of-day sessions
   exist (honest degrade, not a fabricated ratio off a short window).

2. Initiative vs responsive -- a session value area is built fresh each bar
   from that session's bars-so-far: a TPO-style histogram over N_BINS=30
   uniform price bins spanning the bars-so-far range, where each bar adds
   one unit of "presence" to every bin its [low, high] range covers (the
   OHTC-bar analogue of a TPO bracket touching a price level -- see
   `value_area_from_bars`). POC = bin with the most bars touching it (ties
   broken by proximity to the touched range's centre, matching MACD mini's
   tie-break). Value area = the alternating POC-outward expansion until
   >=70% of total touches are included -- the same algorithm shape as MACD
   mini's Profile.value_area(), adapted from tick-letters to bar-touches
   because only OHLC bars are available here, not ticks.
   Directional volume: this bar's volume signed by close vs. the session's
   own VWAP-to-date (typical price (H+L+C)/3, cumulative through this bar).
   initiative = close beyond the value area AND signed volume agrees with
   that direction (above VA + net-buying volume, or below VA + net-selling).
   responsive = close beyond the value area but volume does NOT agree
   (the fade/rejection signature the spec names).

3. Opening-range state -- first bar of the session (09:15-09:45 IST) fixes
   or_high/or_low. Every later bar in that session is inside/above/below
   that range; if outside, by how many ATR(14) (daily, computed from
   session-aggregated OHLC, using only the 14 sessions BEFORE the current
   one -- never the current session's own still-forming range) the close
   sits beyond the boundary. The opening bar itself is not yet classifiable
   (the range it defines has not closed) and is marked "forming", mirroring
   MACD mini's open_type()/day_type() distinction between "too early" and
   an actual reading.

4. Value-area position -- va_position = (close - va_low) / (va_high -
   va_low) for the bar's own developing value area, UNCLIPPED: inside the
   value area this is naturally in [0, 1]; outside, the same ratio already
   extends past 1 or below 0 by exactly the right amount (e.g. 1.15 = "0.15
   value-area-widths above VAH"), so no separate clipped/unclipped pair of
   columns is needed -- the spec's "clipped to [0,1] with values outside
   stored as signed distance" is exactly what this one unclipped ratio is.

COMPOSITE timing_state (this build's own thresholds -- spec gives only
IGNITION's definition in full)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checked in this priority order (first match wins) so the four states are
mutually exclusive per bar:

  IGNITION    RVOL20 >= 2.0 AND initiative activity AND price beyond value
              area, in the direction that symbol's sector20's most recent
              PRIOR-session rs_z20 favours (rs_z20 > 0 favours "above";
              rs_z20 < 0 favours "below"). If sector_rs has no prior-session
              row for that sector20 (or is unsigned/0), sector confirmation
              cannot be evaluated and IGNITION does not fire on this bar --
              an honest degrade rather than assuming alignment.

  EXHAUST     RVOL20 >= 1.5 AND responsive activity (high-volume rejection
              at a value-area extreme -- climactic volume that fails to
              hold beyond value, the auction-theory exhaustion signature).
              Does not require sector alignment: exhaustion is a rejection
              regardless of which way the sector leans.

  COMPRESSION RVOL20 <= 0.7 AND this bar's range (high-low) vs. its own
              trailing-20-session same-time-of-day mean (`range_ratio`)
              <= 0.7 AND close is inside the value area. Low participation,
              tight range, price contained -- the coiled-spring inverse of
              IGNITION.

  BALANCED    Everything else, including every bar where RVOL20 is not yet
              defined (insufficient trailing history) -- the state that
              carries no directional claim.

timing_score in [0, 100] -- three additive, independently capped components
(documented so a later phase can recompute or re-weight it):
  volume component   (0-40): min(RVOL20 / 3.0, 1.0) * 40           -- 0 if RVOL20 undefined
  location component (0-30): min(|va_position - 0.5| * 2, 2) / 2 * 30
                              (0 at value-area centre, 30 at >=1 full
                              value-area-width beyond VAH/VAL)
  activity component (0/15/30): 30 if initiative, 15 if inside value
                              (neutral), 0 if responsive (a fade subtracts
                              conviction, it does not add it)

    `underlying_spot_candles` also carries bars OUTSIDE the NSE equity
    session and, for some symbols, on a SECOND grid offset by 15 minutes
    (:00/:30 rather than the exchange's :15/:45). Both leaked straight into
    `timing`. Two consequences, both real and both silent:

      * RVOL20 and range_ratio bucket by time-of-day. An off-grid 10:00 bar
        and an on-grid 10:15 bar are different buckets, so a symbol carrying
        both had its trailing statistics computed from half as many
        observations as it appeared to have.
      * M6 evaluates `WHERE tm.ts = <one exact timestamp>`. With two grids in
        the table the evaluated universe swung between roughly 55 and 208
        symbols depending on which grid the latest bar happened to land on --
        a non-deterministic denominator underneath every skip-rate and
        coverage number the lane reports.

    Bars are start-of-bar labelled, so the session's own 13 bars start at
    09:15 through 15:15 (the last covering the 15:15-15:30 stub). Anything
    outside that window, or off the :15/:45 grid, is dropped here.

    The drop is COUNTED and returned on the frame's `.attrs` so callers can
    report it. A symbol that lives entirely on the other grid will now
    produce zero bars, and that must be loud rather than a quiet absence --
    __main__ prints the per-reason counts on every run.
