"""M6 -- Fusion & Trade Selection.

Combines M2 (flow_score), M3 (GEX regime), M4 (sector20 RS + lead-lag), M5
(timing) into one candidate list and, subject to M7's risk gate, a handful
of trade tickets. Per the spec's own framing (doctrine #2: "The system's
default answer is NO TRADE. It must justify acting, never justify
waiting.") this is expected to emit ZERO tickets on most evaluations -- see
the empirical skip-rate this module itself prints on every run.

CADENCE, and why the four inputs are joined the way they are: features_flow
and sector_rs/leadlag are computed once per SESSION (EOD); regime and timing
are computed per 30-MINUTE bar intraday. M6 evaluates at each timing bar
(the intraday trigger) and joins the most recent EOD readings available
BEFORE that bar's own day -- never that day's own not-yet-computed EOD
figures.

CANDIDATE FILTER, direction-first, evaluated as SIX NAMED LEGS. Every symbol
with a timing bar goes through them and is journaled to
`candidate_evaluations` with each leg's own verdict -- see migration 006 for
why (the previous code dropped non-survivors with a bare `continue` before a
Candidate object existed, so `tickets` could explain why four things failed
the conviction gate and nothing at all about why thousands failed the
filter, which is the only question the lane actually needs answered):

  flow_present   features_flow has ANY prior-session row for this symbol
  flow_fresh     that row is <= FLOW_MAX_AGE_SESSIONS trading sessions old
                 AND was built from >= FLOW_MIN_INGREDIENTS non-NULL
                 ingredients. NEITHER HALF OF THIS LEG EXISTED before the
                 2026-08-27 review. The LATERAL joins had no lower time bound
                 at all, so with features_flow frozen at 2026-07-28 and the
                 cycle daemon evaluating every 30 minutes, live bars were
                 joining a month-old flow score and treating it as
                 "yesterday's EOD reading". Nothing in the code objected;
                 only the accident of regime being NULL kept tickets from
                 being emitted on it. An input with no stated shelf life is
                 not a feature, it is a leak. The ingredient count is the
                 second half because ~42% of the historical candidate pool
                 was a saturated +/-100 flow score derived from a SINGLE
                 ingredient -- and the one ingredient most often surviving
                 alone (O/S) carries no direction at all.
  flow_strength  flow_score >= +CE_FLOW_MIN_ABS for the CE case, or
                 <= -PE_FLOW_MIN_ABS for the PE case                     (M2)
                 SIGNED, not absolute: the two sides are separate selectors
                 with their own bars, so a bearish score can never arm the
                 bullish case and be vetoed later by a different leg.
  sector_rs      sign(rs_z20) == direction AND |rs_z20| >= SECTOR_RS_MIN_ABS_Z,
                 with the RS row <= RS_MAX_AGE_SESSIONS sessions old     (M4)
  regime         a GEX regime bucket is a market-STRUCTURE reading, not a
                 view-direction one -- negative/neutral dealer gamma is
                 momentum-friendly regardless of which way the candidate
                 itself points (positive gamma dampens realized moves,
                 negative amplifies them). Permits STRONG_NEG/NEG/NEUTRAL,
                 and the bucket must be <= REGIME_MAX_AGE_BARS bars old.
  timing         timing_state == 'IGNITION' AND timing_score >= TIMING_MIN_SCORE
                 AND the break went THIS SIDE'S WAY -- M5 fires IGNITION on
                 "price beyond value area" and records which side in
                 va_position (> 0 above, < 0 below). Without that check a CE
                 candidate could be confirmed by a breakdown; on 2026-08-28
                 three of the four IGNITION bars were below value. An
                 unrecorded va_position fails, since the direction of the
                 break is the entire content of this leg.

Legs are evaluated in that order and SHORT-CIRCUIT: once one fails, the rest
are journaled NULL rather than FALSE, so "did not pass" is never confused
with "was never asked".

CONVICTION -- each component rescaled to [0,100] BEFORE the spec's own
0.35/0.20/0.20/0.15/0.10 weights, direction-aligned so a confirming bearish
reading scores the same as a confirming bullish one:
  flow      := |flow_score|                                    (already 0-100)
  sectorRS  := (clip(direction * rs_z20, -3, 3) + 3) / 6 * 100
  timing    := timing_score                                    (already 0-100)
  regime    := {STRONG_NEG:100, NEG:75, NEUTRAL:50, POS:25, STRONG_POS:0}[bucket]
               (direction-agnostic -- a structural reading, not a view)
  leadlag   := 50 if best_lag <= 0 else 50 + min(50, corr*100)
  conviction = 0.35*flow + 0.20*sectorRS + 0.20*timing + 0.15*regime + 0.10*leadlag

Conviction is computed for EVERY symbol whose components exist, not only for
filter survivors -- a "shadow conviction" on the full cross-section. That is
what research/cross_section_ic.py needs: correlating a component with forward
return INSIDE its own filter restricts its range to near-nothing and
guarantees an uninformative coefficient, which is what attribution_runs was
doing.

GATE: conviction >= 85 AND rank <= 3 (by conviction, within this bar's
surviving candidate set) AND M7.risk_check() allows. Every candidate that
clears the FILTER is additionally recorded in `tickets` with emitted=false
and a gated_reason when it fails the GATE or risk check.

INSTRUMENT/PRICING: Vanguard trades the underlying's current ATM option
(CE for bullish, PE for bearish) -- see the scope note in fusion/m7_risk.py.
entry is the option's own last traded premium; stop/targets are
percent-of-premium, using the 15/20/10 (stop/trail-activation/trail)
configuration this SAME research programme found materially outperforms a
naive 30% stop on real August 2026 option data (paired t=10.4) -- target1 is
the trail-activation level (+20%), target2 a further +50% extension.
