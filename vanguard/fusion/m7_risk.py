"""M7 -- Risk & Sizing. Veto authority over every ticket M6 wants to emit.

Defaults are the spec's own (Section 3, M7):
  - risk per trade 0.75% of capital AT STOP; hard cap 1.0%
  - premium paid is capped separately at 1.5% of capital
  - sizing: 0.25x fractional Kelly from a rolling 60-trade edge estimate;
    fixed-fractional until 60 closed trades exist AND the measured edge
    clears its own confidence interval (see kelly_risk_pct)
  - max concurrent 3; max per sector20 = 2; portfolio heat <= 2.5%
  - daily loss stop -2.0% -> STAND-DOWN, no new tickets until next session
  - weekly loss stop -4.0% -> stand-down + mandatory review flag
  - event guard: no fresh tickets 1 session before a symbol's results date

TWO NUMBERS, NOT ONE -- and why this changed on 2026-08-27
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This module used to size on the FULL PREMIUM and then store that figure in
`sizing_risk_rupees`, on the argument that an option can gap through its
stop to zero. The argument is sound; using it as the sizing basis was not,
because every downstream limit is denominated in that same column:

    premium <= 0.75% of capital, stop at -15% of premium
      => an actual stop-out costs 0.1125% of capital
      => the -2.0% daily stand-down needs ~18 stop-outs in one session
      => with MAX_CONCURRENT_POSITIONS = 3, it can never fire.

The weekly stop, the 2.5% heat cap and the 1.0% hard cap were all loose by
the same ~6.7x factor, and MAX_PREMIUM_PER_TRADE_PCT was unreachable dead
code (0.75% of capital as premium is always below a 1.5% premium cap). A
limit that is measured and then cannot bind is worse than no limit, because
the number sitting in the journal implies it was being respected.

So the two quantities are now separate and BOTH bind:

  risk_rupees     = (entry - stop) * lots * lot_size
                    Capital at risk if the stop fills as intended. This is
                    what portfolio heat, the daily stand-down and the weekly
                    stop are denominated in. 3 x 0.75% = 2.25% <= the 2.5%
                    heat cap, which is the arithmetic the spec's own numbers
                    were chosen for.
  premium_rupees  = entry * lots * lot_size
                    The most a gap-to-zero can take. Capped at
                    MAX_PREMIUM_PER_TRADE_PCT independently. With a 15% stop
                    this cap is the one that usually binds (0.75% at stop
                    implies 5% of capital in premium, well over 1.5%), so
                    the gap risk the old code was worried about is still
                    controlled -- by the cap built for it, rather than by
                    disabling every other limit.

Pre-006 tickets stored premium in `sizing_risk_rupees`; migration 006 labels
them `sizing_risk_basis = 'full_premium'` rather than rewriting them.

Scope decision (stated once, honestly): every position sized here is an
INTRADAY thesis with an EOD time stop. The spec's "positional, T+3 unless
target-1 hit" variant is a real, separate instrument class the spec
describes but this build does not yet distinguish -- M6 does not yet emit a
positional-vs-intraday flag, so there is nothing for this module to key a
T+3 rule on. Documented here rather than silently defaulted.

This module NEVER places an order and NEVER calls a broker API -- it only
computes a position size and a yes/no gate from data already in Postgres
(open `fills`/`outcomes` rows, `paper_capital_daily`, `sector_taxonomy`,
`results_calendar`). It is deliberately pure/query-only so M6 can call
`risk_check()` synchronously while building a ticket.

          daily/weekly stops to match (roughly -0.6% / -1.2% for the same
          "three stop-outs and stand down" behaviour the -2% number implies);
      (c) widen the stop -- a 50% stop makes 1.5% premium and 0.75% risk
          agree exactly, at the cost of a completely different trade.
